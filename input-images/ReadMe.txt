we aquire 8 retinal images every time. 
we use dual align i2kretina to correct the eye movement.
the 8 frames can be found under raw data aligned.
we take the 8 frames and create a ratio movie - meaning, differntial movie. 
playing the new ratio frames allows us to see the motion and use the motion contrast\calculate velocity for the next steps of the process.
you may see the movie in the Output folder (play with VLC, imageJ, etc).
similar to the first small test, we would like to see your approcah to create a similar movie using the raw data.
if you decide to write a code, please also write your steps in pseudo code; adding the rational behind the step would be helpful.

Thanks and good luck, please feel free to write to amiram@opt-imaging.com and sagier@opt-imaging.com if needed.
